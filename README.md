This is the code for [Andy Zeng](https://andyzeng.github.io/)'s academic website. Notably, this uses [Isotope](https://isotope.metafizzy.co/) to create subpages, so you can get fancy with "sort by category" features if you want to. You can customize the `data-filter` and `data-category` fields, as well as Isotope parameters in the JS code at the bottom of `index.html`. Feel free to download this for your own personal use. Remember to delete the analytics tags at the top of `index.html` that you do not want on your own website. I'd appreciate a link back to my website. Inspired by [Jon's website](https://jonbarron.info/).
